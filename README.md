<h3> This is an Assessment for Digital Technologies NCEA Level 2 Term 2 </h3>
<p> The website is about re-reselling books that have been donated by people who have already used them but did not want to get rid of them because of it's value. </p>
<p> I love reading and also have a passion for books so somehow I understand the 'donors' reason for donating to a certain level since I too, do not want to get rid of the books that I have right now. I would rather have someone else who loves books as much as I do ave it instead of throwing it away. :) </p>
<p> I decided to make this website because 1. It's one of my interests, 2. I already made an art website last year so I can't (chose not to do that) do that this year, 3. I like my idea. </p>
